    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a recent graduate from Tinbergen Institute. At Tinbergen Institute I specialized in finance and econometrics. 
      My working experience has been both in theoretical and empirical financial research. For example, empirically I have conducted research into the impact of
      Covid-19 on trading flows in future markets using Vector Autoregressive (VAR) and Vector Error Correction Models (VECM). Theoretically I have developed a
      continuous-time investment model with ESG investors. This model developped by me during my master at Tinbergen Institute is simulated using Ordinary Differential
      Equation (ODE) solvers to show how environmental regulation and investors' preferences for ESG affect sustainable investments. For my work I have been awarded various
      scholarships and research grants (in total approximately â‚¬20.000). I have declined a PhD position at Erasmus University Rotterdam to search for a job in industry.
      Currently I am working as a teacher in a high school while I am searching for a job in industry.
